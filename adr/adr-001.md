### ADR 1: Implementation of `reservation-svc` for CRUD operations on the reservation DB

#### Status

ACCEPTED

#### Context and Problem Statement

Trippix, the next-gen online trip management dashboard, needs a robust backend service that can handle the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the reservation database seamlessly. The service must be able to process the reservation data, retrieved from various sources including emails, promptly and efficiently.

#### Decision drivers

* Requirement to have a centralized service handling all CRUD operations on the reservation database.
* Ensuring the richest user interface possible across all deployment platforms.
* Meeting the high demands of 2 million active weekly users and a total of 15 million user accounts.

#### Considered Options

1. Creating a separate `reservation-svc` dedicated to CRUD operations on the reservation database.
2. Integrating CRUD operations into an existing service without a dedicated reservation service.

#### Decision

Create a dedicated `reservation-svc` for handling all CRUD operations on the reservation database.

__Reasons:__
* Streamlining the backend processes.
* Ensuring a singular point of control and maintenance for reservation data.
* Facilitating smoother integrations with other components of the system through well-defined APIs.

#### Consequences

* Additional development and maintenance efforts for a dedicated service.
* Higher initial setup complexity.
* The singular service might become a bottleneck if not properly scaled to handle the high user load.
